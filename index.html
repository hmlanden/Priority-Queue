        <p>This was done for an assignment for a CS class during my last quarter of college. The basic goal was to create a Priority Queue using a variety of mechanisms, ranging from Vectors to utilizing linked lists, in order to see differences in efficiency and to drive home the point that there are many different ways to implement things. </p>

<p>Some code might not entirely make sense, as I was making full use of the Stanford libraries as they were provided to us, but the intentions should all be readily comprehensible.</p>

<p>Four different priority queues are included, based on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Vectors</li>
<li>Linked lists</li>
<li>Doubly-linked Lists</li>
<li>Heaps</li>
</ul>
